## Information of the world happniess report
This app shows the happiness score across countries and regions in 2021.
The data is from the Gallup World poll .
The dataset was found on Kaggle.
Here are different regional happiness score as an example.
We made three different graph for it. They are bar charts, scatter charts, and tables.

## Widgets and Panels
* The opening page will introduce what user will see in our project, such as the importance of our project and the source of data.
* The second page could help user have a better understanding of different region's ladder score. User could use widget to select which region they want to see. And main panel will be a bar chart to visualize the ladder score. The number of bars in the chart can be changed according to the user's input and choices.
* The third One is scatter charts. From this scatter plot we can clearly see the correlation between ladder score and Logged GDP per capita. If Trend line is an upward trend, then the two variables are positively correlated. It proves that the higher the GDP is, the higher the Ladder score is. If the Trend Line is trending down, then the two variables are negatively correlated. It indicates that the higher the GDP, the lower the Ladder Score.
* The fourth picture is a table. There are two tables that are fixed. They record the countries with the highest and the lowest Ladder Score, respectively. Users can change the region according to their needs by using the option bar on the right. Thus, the situation in different regions can be viewed. The chart includes the average, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and median of Healthy life expectancy and Ladder score.
* The final page will conclude notable insigth discovered in this project with a graph, broder implications of the insight, the quality of data and how can this project be improved in the future.
